            <p>Hello, my sweetest friend. I want you to know that I’m blessed to have a great friend like you. Your friendship is invaluable to place a price tag on, and it’s more precious than the finest gold and silver in the entire universe. You’ve touched my heart in so many ways that I could never have thought of your care and love, and I will always treasure our friendship with every breath in me. I love you, my beautiful friend.</p>

            <p>Being with you motivates and inspires me. If I am to repay all that you have done for me all this while, I will need to break into the central bank because there is no money enough to pay you back. My heart will remain grateful and devoted to this friendship forever.</p>

            <p>I might not be able to know everything about you, my dearest, because each day is another avenue for me to know you a bit more than before, to get to be closer to you and cherish you so much more than ever before. And I want you to know that one of the reasons I’m with you is knowing you much better. I adore you, my beautiful friend.</p>
